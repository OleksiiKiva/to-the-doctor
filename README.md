# ToTheDoctor â€¢ project for managing visits, doctors and patients for a medical clinic
___

## Description
A simple service that allows the clinic administrator to make an appointment with a doctor for a patient

- The administrator has all permissions: can create, update, delete visits, doctors and patients 
- The doctors do not have permissions to creating, updating, or deleting doctors

### Logic of use
- **step 1.** The clinic administrator creates a patient if he is not in the clinic database

- **step 2.** Creates a visit, indicating the direction of treatment (for example 
surgery, therapy, rehabilitation, etc.), time and date of the visit, type of visit (initial or repeat)


### Implemented checks:
- date of birth of the patient (an appointment with a doctor is possible from 6 months of age)
- expiration date of the medical certificate
- date of registration for the visit (cannot be less than the current date)


### Implemented a Soft-Delete method
- the process of removing records so that they are still present in the database but are
not accessible to the user


### The models are implemented according to the following diagram:
